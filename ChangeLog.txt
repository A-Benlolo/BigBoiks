November 13, 2019
==================
*BigInteger file created
*Demo file created

November 14, 2019
=================
*Improved the process of converting a string to a table
*Added more comparisons ... greaterThanOrEqualTo and lessThanOrEqualTo
*Added option to print in any base 2-36
*Added option to create a BigInteger from a hexidecimal string
*Added new features to the demo file

November 15, 2019
=================
*Added option to create a BigInteger from any base string 2-36
*Added function to find a multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number
*Added option to raise a BigInteger to a number or another BigInteger
*Increased effeciency by replacing BigInteger.ZERO() calls with a local variable in some functions

November 17, 2019
=================
*Added bitwise operations
*Added function to use Miller-Rabin Primality test
*Increased effeciency by using global variables for numbers 1-10
*Added new features to demo
*Changed demo to compute the value after printing what it is doing to demonstrate the operations that take a longer time

November 23, 2019
=================
*Slightly increased effeciency of Miller-Rabin Primality test
*Added two's complement to print negative binary numbers
*Added option to shift a specified amount left or right.
*Updated the demo to implement the changes.

November 24, 2019
=================
*Recognize 2, 3, and 5 as prime numbers through primality test
*Slightly increased effeciency of primality test

November 27, 2019
=================
